/**
 * Attaches to the long-lived engine pre-warmed in [EdgeApplication] rather than spinning
 * up its own, and refuses to destroy that engine when the Activity is finished. Combined
 * with the EdgeTracking foreground service keeping the process alive, this lets the Dart
 * side (BLE connection + notification relay) keep running after the app is swiped from
 * recents — instead of Android tearing the engine down (onDetachedFromEngine).
 *
 * Platform channels are registered on the engine in EdgeApplication (NativeChannels), not
 * here, so they exist even while no Activity is attached (headless channel calls work).
 * The one exception is CompanionDeviceManager association, which must launch a system
 * dialog — [CompanionBridge] borrows this Activity for that (registered in onCreate,
 * result forwarded from onActivityResult).
 *
 * FlutterFragmentActivity (not FlutterActivity) is required by the `health` plugin — its
 * Health Connect permission flow uses the AndroidX activity-result APIs, which need a
 * FragmentActivity host. The cached-engine overrides work the same on either base.
